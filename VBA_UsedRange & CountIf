Sub Count_If_Formula()
'----
'Description: Macro that finds used range, get the number of cells that have formulas, places the value inside cell B6
'Useful Stuff:
    '"Usedrange" -> The used range within the sheet you specify
    'Dim cell as Range lets you iterate through every cell in a worksheet.
        'Combining these two allows you to tell excel: go through every cell that has been modified! So useful.

    Dim cell As Range
    Dim countformula As Long
    
    For Each cell In ActiveSheet.UsedRange
        If cell.HasFormula Then
            countformula = countformula + 1
        End If
        
    Next cell
    
    Range("B6").Value = countformula
